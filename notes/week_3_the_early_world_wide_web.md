## CERN

where the coolest of the scientist make discoveries.

Browsers on top and data centers on the bottom.

1990 first server is up at CERN

Dr. Robert Cailliau, co-inventor of World Wide Web, _1994 - the year of the web_, when web becomes more available to the public.
main intention for the WWW were:
- collaborative creation and editing of docs with researchers around the world
- improve world economy
- public facing internet for public to use.

- sending physics research documents across the world.

HTML as bad as tech, absolute headings, 

Links as a connection, not ugle URL's

The internet was infrastructure - the web gave the Inernet a user-interface and URLs.

Images pop up in another screen, due to slow network.

Original internet design intended _collective editing_ on servers all around the world.
