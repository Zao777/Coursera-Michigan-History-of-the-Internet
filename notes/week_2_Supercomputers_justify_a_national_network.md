Supercomputers_justify_a_national_network
---

abstract:
Supercomputers were a great resource yet costly, not enough money could afford every University a Supercomputer, thus the network concept was deviced to hook schools to Supercomputer centers. Supercomputers and Univesities being the driving force for what will become the modern Internet.

## Stored and forward messaging -

a queue like method of sending files from a computer to another machine via networks.

**hops** - latency, adding more nodes to the netwrok as an aleternative to long lease lines between few nodes.

## academia computer networks

leased lines - dedicated connections for computers on a network

store and forward connecting - queue like method for transferring data 
	across a network, it would queue all the data from a machine and
	wait for an open connection before sending data. Once it was sending 
	the data, the data would load, one by one across the line to the next
	machine until reaching it’s destination: it was timely and not effective
	method.
	
1980s


hops - more networks meant more latency yet could connect more schools than 
	using long dedicated lines between schools.


BITNET network - make connections between campuses and files queued and forwarded through network.


## ARPA (Advance Research Projects Agency) Research Network

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET 

- reliability, redundancy, overcome partial failure

_ARPA_, more than military needs (Russian threat), used to make computers and computer
networks more easy and effective to use.

Resistance to partial failure, keeping information flowing despite failure on 
the limited network lines.

1969, leased lines for feature among exclusive schools. Deal with redundancy.

1960s-1980s transport many messages simultaneously and efficiently, dynamically handle data. 

> modern internet largely influenced from ARPA network research.

**Packet Switching** - major innovation from ARPA research, efficient message transmission.

way better method than the Store-and-Forward method.

with **packets**, the message is broken down into cells or packets and then are send 
across the network and rearrange into message to be read by end-user, packets do 
not rely on a line to the destination, they can take different routes and arrive 
at different times, eventually all of them getting to the final destination.

Post office analogy.

**Routers** - special-purpose computers, traffic control for packets.

The ARPA network was the technical foundation of the Internet, it used packet-switching technology and implemented the Internet Protocol Suite, TCP/IP. 

ARPA Network came before NSFNET, Nation Science Foundation Network,  


## Supercomputers

Supercomputers were great for research but buying each University a Supercomputer would be expensive but networking the Supercomputers would be more efficient.

### Larry Smarr 

NCSA, first national network, transform the computer research product into a more public commodity.

Supercomputers justify a national network backbone.

Solutions arose from the problem of inefficient ways to gaining access to Supercomputers.

## University of Michigan influence on the Internet

Univ. of Michigan not on the ARPANet because they built their own 3 node leased line network.

**Merit** - one of the earliest networks that connected the 3 Universities in Michigan.

Michigan wouldn’t get a Supercomputer but had a plan to gain access to the Supercomputer _network_.


## NSFNET, National Science Foundation Network, 
in 1985 a national fund arose for Supercomputing centers and connect those centers 
with a national network, NSFNet.

Project was to create the first nationwide TCP/IP network for all users, this project was awarded to the Univ. of Michigan and their show-of-proof Merit Network, IBM and MCI and the State of Michigan.
